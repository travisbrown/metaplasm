I had a lot of fun doing this thing [a couple of years ago](https://meta.plasm.us/posts/2016/12/24/best-new-fiction-of-2016/),
so I thought I'd go ahead and give up the pretense of this being a tech blog and do it again. I don't drink now so it
wasn't as fun as last time, but if I convince one person to read Suttree or The Little Friend (or to skip Lincoln on the Bardo) it'll have been worth it.

I've included Amazon links for convenience but if you're buying physical books please try your local bookstore
first instead.

### [Suttree](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004FV4T4S) by Cormac McCarthy (1979)

This book is the answer to the question "How can I write a novel that's half drunk people arguing
and half overwrought descriptions of carinated domes or withy roods or whatever and not have it
be annoying as fuck?" It's impossible to describe or quote this book in a way that doesn't make
it sound like a chore, but somehow it's one of the most beautiful and sad books you'll ever read,
even though it has no plot and isn't about anything and parts of it come really close to feeling
like parody and you'll probably have to look up a bunch of words like "neap" and "flitch".

### [The Little Friend](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005PRJJOQ) by Donna Tartt (2002)

I enjoyed [The Secret History](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005PRJT9Q) when I read it in 2005 or 2006, and I
bought [The Goldfinch](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00C74SHRK) the day it was published in 2013, but somehow I don't think I knew
Tartt had written a novel between those two until this year. It's a strange book. It's almost as
plot-free as Suttree. There's a cobra (in Mississippi). There are some convincing and sympathetic
depictions of meth use. I have no idea what the title means. A twelve-year-old girl spends most of
the novel trying to kill someone. I think it's my favorite Tartt novel so far.

### [The Sparsholt Affair](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B072KDRYKH) by Alan Hollinghurst (2017)

This book is superficially a lot like [The Stranger's Child](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00500YCCC), except that it's good. Not
[The Swimming-Pool Library](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1582346100) good or [The Line of Beauty](B002TTICDC) good or
[The Folding Star](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0042JSSWW) good, more like [The Spell](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0043D2D6Y)
good, but at least it's good, and I can look forward to Hollinghurst novels again.

### [Milkman](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07B8WPQB8) by Anna Burns (2018)

I highlighted a bunch of phrases in my Kindle copy of this book because I thought they were
hilarious, but when I pulled them up in a browser after finishing the novel they were all things
like "Then I realised this floor was good".

### [The Which Way Tree](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B079H55K49) by Elizabeth Crook (2018)

I picked up this book because of the historical context: it's set in central Texas in the aftermath of the
Civil War, and is in part about the conflicts between Confederate soldiers and German immigrants that
killed my (German immigrant) great-great-great-grandfather. I didn't expect or need it to be
good, but it is. I don't really know Western fiction as a genre, but the last few new westerns I've
read—this one, Paulette Jiles's [News of the World](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01122BZNK), and Sebastian Barry's [Days Without End](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01FWPGBE6)—have all been
excellent, with this being maybe the most convincingly imagined of the three. 

### [The Wind-Up Bird Chronicles](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005TKD5W6) by Haruki Murakami (1997)

Last fall I read [What I Talk About When I Talk About Running](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005TKD8ZK), but that's the only Murakami book I'd
read before this one. It felt like a good starting place, or at least I'm planning to read more Murakami
in 2019.

### [Elmet](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B06VWXLQ8Y) by Fiona Mozley (2017)

Somehow I read a lot of novels this year about kids growing up in unusual environments where they're orphaned
or on drugs or living off the grid or whatever: History of Wolves, The Which Way Tree,
Milkman, Marlena, The Great Alone, A Station on the Path [...], to some degree Warlight, The Witch Elm, The Mars Room.
This is probably the best of them. 

### [History of Wolves](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01GHMZYI2) by Emily Fridlund (2017)

I read this book in one long morning in some mountains in Southern California and I found it so upsetting I had
to drive down to the beach, but it didn't help. It's bleak and quietly horrifying and it's almost as appalling that
Lincoln in the Bardo won the 2017 Booker Prize with History of Wolves on the shortlist as it is that Lincoln in the
Bardo won the 2017 Booker Prize with Elmet on the shortlist (I don't like Lincoln in the Bardo).

### [The Mars Room](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B075RX1YLM) by Rachel Kushner (2018)

Somehow when I started reading this book I thought it was a true story (maybe I'd confused it with [Cherry](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07F1D2QP3)?),
and when I found out it wasn't, the experience of reading it became weirdly uncomfortable. It's a very funny book, but 
a lot of the pleasure of reading it (for me, at least) was of the "wow I'm glad my life isn't _that_ fucked up"
kind. Maybe I'm just sensitive about portrayals of humanities grad school dropouts.

### [The Likeness](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002V092CY) by Tana French (2008)

The circumstances in this book are too unlikely to be even vaguely believable, but I didn't really care. The
representation of the life of the little circle of grad student housemates is one of the most charming and
attractive things I've ever read. Otherwise The Witch Elm and maybe even In the Woods are far better.

### [Bel Canto](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FC10S4) by Ann Patchett (2001)

This is an intensely artificial book about an intensely artificial situation, but it works.

### [The Swimming-Pool Library](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0043D2D32) by Alan Hollinghurst (1988)

After The Sparsholt Affair I went back through the Hollinghurst novels I'd never read before, and this was
my favorite of them. I'm still not sure it's as good as The Line of Beauty or The Folding Star, but it's the
best of the big multi-generational ones.

### [The Spell](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0043D2D6Y) by Alan Hollinghurst (1998)

There are a lot of things to like about this novel, but I found the kindness and thoughtfulness of the
representations of drug use especially remarkable.

### [Everything is Illuminated](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003UV91B0) by Jonathan Safran Foer (2002)

Fun, but the movie was better.

### [Look to Windward](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003MQM7A0) by Iain M. Banks (2000)

I didn't read much science fiction this year, and had thought I'd read all of the Culture novels
long ago, but somehow I'd missed this one. It's not my favorite, but it might be the saddest Banks novel
I've read.

### [The Witch Elm](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07C1XRQVJ) by Tana French (2018)

This is the first novel I read by Tana French, and I thought it was a fairly decent mystery novel up
until the bizarre fight in the garden near the end, when I decided it was a fairly excellent mystery
novel.

### [In the Woods](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002V091ZW) by Tana French (2007)

Tana French is remarkably good at drawing relationships that you want to live in—the housemates in
The Likeness, the (young) cousins in The Witch Elm, the partners here—and then brutally fucking them
up. There are things about this novel that are frustrating (e.g. it's more predictable than it thinks it
is), but many little parts of it are lovely.

### [The Great Alone](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B06Y5WRS2C) by Kristin Hannah (2018)

Of all the novels I read this year about children trying to negotiate relationships with violent men,
this is probably the most terrifying. The transition to feel-good novel felt a little forced to me,
but it still feels good.

### [Outer Dark](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003XT605E) by Cormac McCarthy (1968)

After re-reading the Border Trilogy this summer I decided I needed to go back through McCarthy's
earlier novels, most of which I'd never read before. I think I'd avoided them because the one
pre-western McCarthy novel I had read (maybe a decade and a half ago) was [Child of God](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003XT60I6), which I
hated at the time (and hated just as much when I read it again this year). Suttree is the opposite
of Child of God—instead of a polished little piece of nastiness it's a big goofy baggy mess—while
Outer Dark is like halfway between the two.

### [The Orchard Keeper](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003XT60HM) by Cormac McCarthy (1965)

This book is confusing. If you say you've read this book and can summarize the plot I probably
won't believe you. There's a synopsis on the Wikipedia page that seems fairly reasonable but who
knows.

### [Transcription](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B077Z31M86) by Kate Atkinson (2018)

Like Warlight but better.

### [Warlight](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B073R64ZTK) by Michael Ondaatje (2018)

I used to love novels like this, really self-serious ones with dramatic revelations and big
love stories or whatever. I guess I'm glad Ondaatje is still churning them out a couple of times
a decade but I don't really care.

### [The Music Shop](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01JNZ6BO6) by Rachel Joyce (2017)

This is a kind book about kind people. It's not perfect but it's memorable and worth reading.

### [Marlena](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01LYYHKFR) by Julie Buntin (2017)

To be honest I don't remember much of the plot of this book, and I think in my head it's mixed up with
some true crime podcast I listened to around the same time. It's a fairly conventional representation
of drug abuse and teenagerhood, but it's nicely told (and is the last book on this list that I'd
recommend without qualification, so feel free to skip the rest).

### [Lincoln in the Bardo](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01FPH2N0C) by George Saunders (2017)

This has my vote for most overrated book of the decade (so far, but it'd be hard to beat).

### [Fear](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B06XKB39DK) by Dirk Kurbjuweit (2017)

I can't remember the last time I read a contemporary German novel, and this one is about as
humorless and colorless and preoccupied with serious questions in a serious way as you'd expect.

### [Lethal White](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07FD8PFJM) by Robert Galbraith (2018)

I'd originally ranked this novel much lower but you know what, I had a lot of fun reading it,
unlike the next few boring-ass critically-celebrated books on this list by boring-ass
critically-celebrated men.

### [A Station on the Path to Somewhere Better](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B075RSWTJ3) by Benjamin Wood (2018)

The worst thing about the first-person narration in this novel is that it suggests pretty strongly
that the narrator isn't going to be one of the murder victims, which is disappointing because he's
just so incredibly annoying.

### [The Only Story](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B073HY7YV8) by Julian Barnes (2018)

I always get Julian Barnes confused with Ian McEwan and probably two or three even less memorable
British men. I don't regret reading this book exactly but I'm already well on my way to forgetting everything
about it.

### [Moving Kings](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01M64VAFR) by Joshua Cohen (2017)

I kind of appreciate how this novel doesn't even try to make all these more-or-less horrible men
it's about sympathetic, but that's the most I can say for it.

### [Faithful Place](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003TSD9RG) by Tana French (2010)

This was a let-down after The Likeness. I'll probably read the rest of these books at some
point, but first I'll have to forget what a slog this one was.

### [The Reckoning](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B079DBS447) by John Grisham (2018)

For some reason I really wanted to read a novel about farmers a couple of months ago, and this
novel about farmers had just come out. It's not terrible (except for the ending), but it feels
disjointed and in need of some editorial attention. I should have re-read something by Smiley
instead.

### [Artemis](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B06ZZMYC4G) by Andy Weir (2017)

This is basically one of those Ian McDonald moon books but the politics are boring and the dialogue
is bad. Even the science feels sloppy, unlike that Mars book, which is the only reason I gave Weir
a chance.

### [The Outsider](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B078M5G7XH) by Stephen King (2018)

I started writing this mini-review by saying that this novel is like something a neural network trained
on King's last few books would spit out, but it's not, because that would probably be weird, or at
least not 100% predictable. 

### [Mrs. Osmond](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01FPH2N0C) by John Banville (2017)

I can't remember the last time I've been so angry that a book exists. If you're going to pull shit
like this it needs to be perfect, and this novel is barely mediocre.
