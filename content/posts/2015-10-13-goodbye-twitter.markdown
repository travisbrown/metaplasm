Today is my last day at Twitter (well, kind of—my email access was shut off this morning, so I've
been spending the day reading a novel).

I'm not sure how I feel about this yet. After some very recent changes in the Twitter Open Source
team, I'd been vaguely thinking about leaving the company anyway, and since I'm not a proud person
(at least I don't think I am), I have no complaints about that happening involuntarily if it means a
severance package. We'll see whether Jack and I agree about the ["generous"][jack] part.

If I tried to recruit you to work at Twitter recently, my apologies—I had no idea this was coming. I
still think it's a great place to work, even though (like most of the rest of the world) I'm not
sure how much confidence I have in its leadership or product direction. There are lots of incredibly
smart and generous people at Twitter. In fact in my experience pretty much everyone there at least
three or four steps from the top of the org chart fits that description. You should probably work
there if you get the chance.

I was told literally nothing about Twitter's plans for the [Twitter Open Source][twitter-oss] team,
which for the past couple of weeks has consisted of two people (counting me). If you're using
Twitter open source software, you're probably okay, especially if you're using a project like
[Finagle][finagle] that's owned by a team that cares a lot about open source (and the Core System
Libraries team does). Because the Open Source team has never been larger than three people,
individual engineering teams have always been primarily responsible for maintaining their own open
source projects, and I'm assuming that's not going to change.

I'll miss pretending to be Finagle on Twitter, but I know I'm leaving [\@finagle][finagle-twitter] in
good hands.

If you're reading this, you probably have some idea about the kind of work I like to do. If you've
got that kind of work, get in touch (preferably [on Twitter][me]). I'm planning to take off at
least a couple of months to read, work on open source projects (including [Finch][finch]!), and
maybe learn some more Rust or Idris or something, but I'm keeping my eyes open.

If I worked with you at Twitter, or if you attended my Twitter University courses, thanks—it was a
great seventeen months.
