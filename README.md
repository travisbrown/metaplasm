Metaplasm
---------

I'm trying out [Hakyll 4](http://jaspervdj.be/hakyll/)
and playing with [Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/)
and [Modernizr](http://modernizr.com/) integration.

Bits of the Hakyll machinery are adapted from sites by
[Ian Ross](https://github.com/ian-ross/blog) and
[Jasper Van der Jeugt](https://github.com/jaspervdj/jaspervdj),
and the current design is inspired by Lucas Lew's
[Whitespace](https://github.com/lucaslew/whitespace) theme for [Octopress](http://octopress.org/).

You can see the result (currently only a demonstration) [here](http://meta.plasm.us/).
